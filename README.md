## What a better DevOps Engineer should learn

- OS - DevOps require you good understanding of operating system concepts. The level required is mainly depends on the company although in my opinion it should be the same level. You should understand how the operating system works, how to troubleshoot and debug issues, etc.
- Programming is part of DevOps. The level again depends on the company. Some will require you to know basic level of scripting while others deep understanding of common algorithms, data structure, design patterns etc.
- Cloud and Containers - while not 100% must in all companies/positions, this skill is on the rise every year and many (if not most) of the positions/companies require this skill. This specifically means: AWS/Azure/GCP, Docker/Podman, Kubernetes, ...
- CI/CD - Be able to to answer questions like "Why do we need CI/CD?" and "What ways and models are there to perform CI/CD?". Eventually, practice assembling such processes and workflow, using whatever tools you feel comfortable with.
